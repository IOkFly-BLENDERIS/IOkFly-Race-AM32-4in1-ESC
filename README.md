# IOkFly-Race-AM32-4in1-ESC
4in1 ESC based on AM32 FW. Developed for quad racing.

Uses AM32 open sourced 32-bit ESC FW

 * Excellent performance, excellent support and excellent community. https://github.com/AlkaMotors/AM32-MultiRotor-ESC-firmware.git
		
No mounting through holes

 * Allows for optimal layout to ensure a direct power flow path to each mosfet.
 * Mounting to frames is achieved with 3D printed customizable and replaceable brackets. Top and bottom in any combination of 20x20 or 30.5x30.5 mm.
		
Split board design

 * Allows to separate all logic components and traces from main power planes for optimal layout of components and somewhat reduces EMI.
 * Reduced heat buildup on sensitive logic components.
 * Allows for uncompromised power plane layers on PDB to achieve excellent power delivery performance.
		
2 Oz copper on all 6 layers of power distribution board

 * Improves current flow.
 * Improves heat distribution and heat capacity.
 * Improves shock durability.
		
High performance Infineon mosfets.

 * In racing power deficit is not an option.
 * IRFH7004TRPBF - https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/irfh7004pbf.pdf?fileId=5546d462533600a40153561ea3e51ed2
	
No current sensor

 * Current sensor and its components take a lot of valuable board space and add small power flow restriction while in racing is almost never used. Best part is no part.
	
FR4 Tg155 board material

 * Higher temperature tolerance and better manufacturing quality.
	
TDK low ESR filtering caps on the main voltage

 * High quality filtering capacitors reduce noise spikes on main power voltage and increase ESC longevity.
