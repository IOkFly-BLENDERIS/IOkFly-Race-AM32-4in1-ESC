# IOkFly-Race-AM32-4in1-ESC
4in1 ESC based on AM32 FW. Developed for quad racing.
Primary features
	1) Uses AM32 opensorced 32-bit ESC FW
		* Excelent performance, excelent support and excelent comunity.
	2) No mounting troug hooles
		* Allows for optimal layout to ensure a direct power flow path to each mossfet.
		* Mounting to frames is achieved with 3D printed customizable and replacable brackets. Top and bottom in any combination of 20x20 or 30.5x30.5 mm.
	3) Split board design
		* Allows to seperate all logic components and traces from main power planes for optimal layout of components and somewhat reduces EMI.
		* Reduced heat buildup on sensetive logic components.
		* Allows for uncompromised power plane layers on PDB to achieve excelent power delivery performance.
	4) 2 Oz copper on all 6 layers of power distribution board
		* Improves current flow.
		* Improves heat distribution and heat capacity.
		* Improves shock durability.
Secondary features
	5) High performance Infineon mossfets.
		* In racing power deficit is not an option.
		* IRFH7004TRPBF - https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/irfh7004pbf.pdf?fileId=5546d462533600a40153561ea3e51ed2
	6) No current sensor
		* Current sensor and it's components takes allot of valuable board spaces and adds small power flow restriction while in racing is almost never used. Best part is no part.
	7) FR4 Tg155 board material
		* Higher temperature tolerance and better manufacturing quality.
	8) TDK low ESR filtering caps on the main voltage
		* High quality filtering capacitators reduces noise spikes on main power voltage and increases ESC longevity.
